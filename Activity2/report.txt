Understanding Network Attacks:

Current Understanding:

As a security analyst, you are aware of the company's reliance on its website for sales and promotions.
You have experience using a monitoring system and packet sniffer for identifying and analyzing network issues.
You understand the impact of an overwhelming number of TCP SYN requests on the web server's performance.
Likely Attack Type:

The symptoms described, such as an abnormal volume of TCP SYN requests overwhelming the web server, are indicative of a TCP SYN flood attack.
In a TCP SYN flood attack, the attacker sends a large number of TCP connection requests, intending to exhaust the server's resources and make it unable to respond to legitimate requests.
Difference Between DoS and DDoS:

Denial of Service (DoS):

In a DoS attack, a single source is used to flood the target system with traffic, causing a disruption in services.
The attacker overwhelms the resources of the target, making it unavailable to users.
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS):

In a DDoS attack, multiple sources (botnets) are coordinated to flood the target system with traffic.
DDoS attacks are often more challenging to mitigate because of their distributed nature.
Website Loading Issue and Connection Timeout:

The website is taking a long time to load, and a connection timeout error is reported because the server is unable to respond to the high volume of incoming TCP SYN requests.
A connection timeout occurs when the server cannot establish a connection within a specified time, and this is likely due to the server's resources being tied up handling the flood of SYN requests.
Taking the server offline temporarily and blocking the suspicious IP address are immediate steps to mitigate the impact.






Attack Description: TCP SYN Flood Attack

Main Symptoms/Characteristics:

Abnormal SYN Requests: The attack involves an overwhelming number of TCP SYN requests.
Unfamiliar IP Address: SYN requests are coming from an unfamiliar IP address.
Connection Timeout: Users experience connection timeout errors when trying to access the website.
Impact on Organization's Network:

Server Overwhelmed: The web server is overwhelmed by the volume of incoming SYN requests.
Loss of Responsiveness: The server loses its ability to respond to legitimate connection requests.
Website Downtime: The website experiences a prolonged loading time and reports connection timeout errors.
Employee Disruption: Employees are unable to access the sales webpage, impacting their ability to search for vacation packages for customers.
Potential Consequences:

Service Disruption: The attack results in a denial of service for legitimate users, affecting business operations.
Financial Loss: Downtime on the sales webpage leads to potential financial losses for the travel agency.
Reputation Damage: Customers may lose trust if they encounter difficulties accessing the company's services, damaging the organization's reputation.
Operational Inefficiency: The attack disrupts the normal functioning of the website and hampers employee productivity.
Prevention Measures:

1. Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting for incoming SYN requests to prevent an excessive number from overwhelming the server.
2. SYN Cookies: Enable SYN cookies to handle connection requests more efficiently and mitigate the impact of SYN flooding.
3. Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS): Deploy IPS to detect and block malicious traffic patterns, providing an additional layer of defense.
4. Traffic Analysis: Regularly analyze network traffic to detect anomalies and patterns indicative of a potential attack.
5. Content Delivery Network (CDN): Use a CDN to distribute and manage traffic, providing resilience against volumetric attacks.
6. Cloud-Based DDoS Protection: Consider cloud-based DDoS protection services that can absorb and filter malicious traffic before it reaches the organization's network.
7. Employee Training: Educate employees on recognizing and reporting unusual network behavior to enhance overall security awareness.
